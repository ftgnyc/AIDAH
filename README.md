# AIDAH

Welcome to the **AIDAH** project repository. This project provides a complete data solution for an educational platform, from schema deployment to data population and analysis.

The project is structured into three main components, following a typical data workflow:

1.  **Infrastructure & Schema**: Terraform is used to define and deploy the data warehouse schema in Google BigQuery.
2.  **Data Population**: SQL scripts are provided to load sample data into the BigQuery tables.
3.  **Data Analysis**: Python scripts are used to execute example queries for data analysis and reporting.

To get started, please follow the documentation in the order below:
